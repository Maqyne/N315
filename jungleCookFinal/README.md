# N315 Jungle Cook Final

[Final](https://in-info-web4.informatics.iupui.edu/~kylperry/n315/jungleCookFinal/) : https://in-info-web4.informatics.iupui.edu/~kylperry/n315/jungleCookFinal/

This assignment is meant to showcase the ability to create a
CRUD application for a recipe website.

The site must have user feedback. ie. alerts.

Data and CRUD

The site must be fully responsive.

The site is styled based on the provided prototype.

I regret that with this application I wasn't able to bring to full fruition.

Despite not being able to, I did attempt to work on the final to the best of my ability.

I managed to build the home page with styling and full responsiveness. (although I didn't manage to make the drop down menu work in that time).
