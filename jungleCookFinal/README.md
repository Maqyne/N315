This assignment is meant to showcase the ability to create a
CRUD application for a recipe website.

The site must have user feedback. ie. alerts.

Data and CRUD

The site must be fully responsive.

The site is styled based on the provided prototype.

I regret taht with this application I wasn't able to bring to full fruition. I tried to bring the home page to life despite lacking the time to fully realize the site.
